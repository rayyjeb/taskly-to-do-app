# Taskly

Taskly is a simple, user-friendly to-do list web application designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. The app allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed while tracking their progress. All task data is stored in the browserâ€™s session storage, ensuring that tasks remain intact during a session. Additionally, users are greeted with a refreshing success-based quote in the welcome text, which changes randomly using an API.

## Features

- **Add New Tasks:** Users can add new tasks to their to-do list.
- **Edit Existing Tasks:** Users can edit any task in the list.
- **Delete Tasks:** Users can remove any task from their list.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed:** Completed tasks are displayed with a line-through style for easy identification.
- **Progress Tracker:** Displays the number of completed tasks out of the total tasks.
- **Random Success-Based Quotes:** Users see refreshing success-based quotes in the welcome text, which change randomly through an API.
